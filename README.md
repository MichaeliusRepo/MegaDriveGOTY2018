# Prototype in C for the Sega Mega Drive
This project used ![SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/sgdk) (Sega Genesis Development Kit) to produce a game for the Sega Mega Drive console (released 1989). Using SGDK allows users to write the game in C code rather than Assembly.

Test-driven-development was used for this project. A seperate C++ unit test project in the solution verifies the functionality of the C code, leading to no programming bugs in the end product.

The game is a simple 3rd-person fighting game, with a simple AI to play against. All visual and audio are original assets.
